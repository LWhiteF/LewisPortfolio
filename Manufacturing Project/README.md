# Report on Manufacturing Defects 2019-2024
### Defect Quantity
2019 through to 2024 the company saw 13000 total defects across all product ranges. Defects were found roughly equally across structural, functional and cosmetic defects.<br>
<br>
The Company saw a peak of 4000 defects in 2021 when action was taken to reduce total defect per year. this was almost double the 6 year average defect quantity.

### Defect Cost
Across 6 years a total of $6.58m have been spent repairing defects. Critical and minor issues averaging higher than moderate issues. Structural issues are pulling the largest proportion of the budget, and cosmetic issues are costing the least to fix.<br>
<br>
the company budgets $1m for yearly repairs, and wants to see the running average drop below this value. Unfortunatly
the running average currently sits at $1.1m. However 2023 and 2024 have kept repair costs under budget at approximatly $0.5m.
the highest cost has been was in 2021, where the total number of defects also peaked.

### Defect Detection
Defects are detecting with three methods. Automated testing, Visual Inspection and Manual Testing.<br>
Most defects are being detected by staff memebers during the QA Process, this is most evident in 2021 when Automated testing dropped below the other methods significantly. however since new procedures have been put into place, the gap between staff and automated detection has decreased.

## Summary

Over the past 3 years, Total Defects and Total Cost have reduced each year, and are significantly less than the peak in 2021. Currently sitting at roughly one quater of the peak for both quantity of defects and total cost seen in 2021, and approximatly half of the 6 year average.<br>
This proves that quality has improved and expenditure has decreased, freeing up approximatly $0.5m of budget.
